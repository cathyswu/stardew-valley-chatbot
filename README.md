# ðŸŒ± Stardew Companion

## ðŸŽ® What is this?

Sometimes when life gets overwhelming, I find myself opening Stardew Valley. Just a couple of hours tending to crops, fishing by the dock, or raising animals, and somehow my worries feel a little smaller.

But ironically, even Stardew can get a little stressful â€” especially when I donâ€™t know what to do next. Should I focus on farming? Mining? Iâ€™d end up googling things or bouncing between the wiki and Reddit threads just to figure out whatâ€™s optimal.

So I decided to build this.

This project is a personal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed specifically for Stardew Valley players. Instead of frantically googling "best crops for spring" or "where to find copper ore" across multiple tabs, you now have a one-stop shop for all your Stardew Valley questions, tips, and tricks.
