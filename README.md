# üå± Stardew Companion

*Your personal AI companion for stress-free farming*

## üéÆ What is this?

Sometimes when life gets overwhelming, I find myself opening Stardew Valley. Just a couple of hours tending to crops, fishing by the dock, or raising animals, and somehow my worries feel a little smaller.

But ironically, even Stardew can get a little stressful ‚Äî especially when I don‚Äôt know what to do next. Should I focus on farming? Mining? I‚Äôd end up googling things or bouncing between the wiki and Reddit threads just to figure out what‚Äôs optimal.

So I decided to build this.

This project is a personal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed specifically for Stardew Valley players. Instead of frantically googling "best crops for spring" or "where to find copper ore" across multiple tabs, you now have a one-stop shop for all your Stardew Valley questions, tips, and tricks.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive Knowledge Base**: Sourced from the [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/) and the [r/StardewValley](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/) community
- **Instant Answers**: No more multiple Google searches - get tips, strategies, and information in one place
- **Stress-Free Gaming**: Focus on relaxing instead of researching
- **Community Wisdom**: Includes both official information and player-discovered strategies
